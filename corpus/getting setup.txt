•	Homework Details:
o	Title: Assignment 1: Environment Configuration and Version Control Setup 
o	Overview: The goal of this assignment is to establish a professional development environment on your local machine. A properly configured environment is the foundation for all future work, ensuring consistency, preventing dependency issues, and enabling version control. You must produce a setup that is isolated, version-controlled, and ready for Python development. 
o	Technical Challenge Requirements: Your final submission must consist of a project folder that demonstrates the following:
	It is a fully initialized local Git repository. 
	It contains a Python virtual environment folder. 
	It includes a .gitignore file configured to correctly ignore the virtual environment folder. 
	It contains a single Python file named hello.py that, when run, prints your name to the console. 
	This hello.py file and the .gitignore file must be successfully committed to the repository's history. 
o	Deliverables: A single, full-screen screenshot of your IDE window. The screenshot must clearly show the file explorer with the hello.py, .gitignore, and virtual environment folders visible, the integrated terminal, activated in the virtual environment, and the output of the git log command showing at least one commit. 

 Hey, class. I wanted to create a quick video for you on getting started with coding and writing programs. Now, this course, we're really going to be focusing on coding and writing programs with the assistance of artificial intelligence. So maybe you have some experience coding. Maybe you don't have any experience coding. But what I'm going to take you through is I'm going to assume that none of you have any experience in coding. And we're going to start from the very beginning. So if this is redundant for you, that's totally fine. but I'm going to show you kind of how we're going to be going about doing it in this class and how we're going to be using AI to help us with our coding. So coding is always done, well, not always done, but we're going to be using an integrated development environment, an IDE, to do our coding. And an IDE is a platform where you can write your code and, you know, deploy apps to run that program and debug and integrate AI with it as well. There's a lot of different ways in which you can write code, so I'm just going to go about doing it. So I'm just going to show you a couple and show you the direction we're going to go in our class. So the first thing that you need to do is, let me open an incognito window here. Let's see. We're going to get to this in a little bit. Let's do a new incognito. Okay, we're going to go to, first and foremost, we're going to go to Python Downloads. Okay, so we're going to go to python.org slash downloads. We're going to download the install manager, and then once that downloads, when you get to your download file, you will see your Python manager. You go ahead and open that up, and you will go through the install steps to install Python on your computer. If you already have that done, you can skip this step, but that's the first thing that you need to do before you can start coding. Okay, so then after you have Python, we want to set up GitHub. GitHub, but we want to do education. Let's see, education. So you might have GitHub already, and that's fine, but GitHub education gives you the pro version. so what you do is just search github education or go to github.com slash education and join github education and you would then create a new account and then for your email you would put in your student email so the it has to have a dot edu or else it won't work it won't verify you as a student so your email at uvu.edu and then you'll continue you'll create your account and once you create your free account it'll validate you and it will um it will get you to your um it'll get you to your github okay so here's my github my dashboard um you can see uh let's see if i go to my profile it'll look something like this you'll see i'm public um Tyson Ryskis, I'm a professor at UVU, I have my uvu.edu, and you can see once I sign up that way, I'm given ProAccount and ProAccount gives me access to GitHub Copilot, which is an AI-assisted coding tool. And so the way that we're going to do that, so once you get that, you'll have access to it. So here I have this chat with Copilot. I can chat here with GitHub Copilot, but we're going to be using the command line interface, okay? And the command line interface allows us to, in our command line, in our IDE, chat with GitHub Copilot. And there's different AI coding tools, so I'm going to show you just a couple of them. Another thing that might be helpful for you is, let's see, Gemini student offer. Gemini for students. You get Google AI Pro for students for free. So you probably want to sign up for that as well. Okay, so there's a couple things that you can do. So once you have a pro version of whether it be Gemini, GitHub Copilot, even if you have like quad code or even chat GPT pro we're going to use that as our large language model to help our coding and we can integrate that into the ide that we select so now that you have python installed you're set up for github copilot now we're going to have and you have one of the pro versions of a large language model set up now we're going to integrate that into our our ide so i'm going to show you this first one Here's VSCode. So let's say that I open a recent one. Let's say, let's open this determination one here. No, I don't want to open that one. Let's open fine tuning. Why not? I created a code to help with fine-tuning let's see if this oh maybe that one doesn't work let me open another one how about my grandpa there we go this works okay so here's the here's what I have going on okay so this is a code that I wrote okay or a program that I wrote so let's say what I have here is this is where my my terminal right here this is where I can run the program but I want to, through my terminal, access my large language model. So once I have my pro version of the large language model, I need to then add it here. So the way that we do that is you do the code npm and then install-g and then for the one we're going to be doing we're going to do at github slash copilot okay so then once i do this it'll say okay we're going to install github copilot um i didn't like that let's see i wonder if i spelled github copilot that looks right i'm busy let's see i was having some issues with this specific file. Let's see. Files logged by another process. Yeah, so this, let me open up another file. File, open recent. Maybe I shouldn't have a file open. Let's do, well, this one's kind of Interesting. Let's just do a different one. Let's do, I did fine-tuning flask, even bookstore. Maybe that'll work. Okay. Get ignore. There we go. Let's just go to flask here. okay so let's go to my app py here let's open up the terminal okay so now that I have this open. Now let's try that. We're going to do npm install g at github slash copilot. So once I do that, then I'll start doing this little guy here, and then it should load up. And then once that loads up, I can just type in co-pilot. And then it will load my GitHub copilot. And if I'm not already logged in, it will have me log in. I've already logged in. So it shows that I'm logged in as this user. And so then it's like, do you want to trust this? I'm going to say yes. And remember this for future sessions. Now in my command line, I can speak with AppCobilot about this specific file so then I can say okay can we expand this flask to include more pages based on your recommendations okay so then we'll and then it's going to start running through all these processes and the great thing about this you can see mine's using Claude Sonnet 4.5 um it's saying okay this is what's going on um I can see you have a basic flask it's kind of analyzing what's going on and now it's going to expand it so it kind of keeps working until um it accomplishes your goal okay so that's what it looks like for this. And then it says, okay, now we're going to go down here. Do you want to make this edit? We're going to say yes, and approve all operations for the rest of the running session. Why not? Actually, no, it's just a yes for that. Okay. So then I'm talking in the flask here, and then if I want to run it, I could open up a new terminal here. Python.py. Okay, this is a development site, so we're going to just go ahead and click on this, and it show me what it built right here okay so I mean super simple anyway that is how you work the command line interface and this is in VS code the same works for cursor so here in cursor I have copilot here let's see let's do a new terminal I have this this working right here let's do a new terminal and for here I'm going to type out jm Gemini now you have to like I did earlier the the npm install, you have to do the same thing for Gemini as you did for Copilot. And so for Gemini, what is the npm command for Gemini? It'd be something like npm install at Google slash genai or something like that. You'd just have to Google it either way. So that'd work. And then let's say that we wanted to do another one so npm for cloud code so what this would look like is you would do npm install at th or something like that I don't know if that's the right one might be looks like it's working. So any command line large language model, yeah, that one worked. So then, let's see, then it would be, no, you'd have to create another file. But anyway, you get the concept. You have to install it, and then you load it, and then you can start talking with it. So that's what's really cool about the CLI. So that's what you're going to be doing in this assignment. You're going to be setting all this up, you're going to be writing a very simple code, and then you're going to push that to your GitHub. And so, you'll need to connect your whatever IDE you're working with to GitHub. So, for me, I'm connected to GitHub here. If I have this app, top PY, let's see should be able to push that anyway so then the idea is once you get the code written you're gonna push it over to your github and where do I have that you're gonna push it over to your github and into your repositories okay and so then it will look something like this and then you'll create a get ignore which will ignore files that you don't need to run the program okay so that's what you're going to be doing for this week getting yourself set up now I wasn't exhaustive and how to do everything because I want you to be able to work your way through it because there's a lot of learning that comes through that so if you have any questions though please reach out and we'll be taking care of
