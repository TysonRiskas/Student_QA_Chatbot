o	Title: Assignment 2: AI-Assisted Interactive Calculator 
o	Overview: The challenge is to create a functional command-line calculator. A successful program will handle user input, perform basic arithmetic, and gracefully manage common errors. You are encouraged to use an AI assistant as a collaborative partner to generate, debug, and explain the code needed to meet the requirements. You can use AI coding assist but don’t use prompt-based coding.
o	Technical Challenge Requirements: You must produce a single Python script that functions as a calculator with the following behaviors:
	The program must first prompt the user to enter a number. 
	Next, it must prompt for an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /). 
	Finally, it must prompt for a second number. 
	The program must calculate and display the result in a clear, human-readable format. 
	Error Handling: The application must not crash if the user enters non-numeric input or attempts to divide by zero. In these error cases, a friendly message should be displayed to the user. 
o	Deliverables:
	A Python script file named calculator.py. 
	A markdown file named README.md containing a brief "AI Collaboration Log" that documents at least one significant prompt you used and how the AI's response helped you solve a part of the challenge. 

 Hello, class. Today I want to walk you through the second assignment, okay? So now that we have everything set up with our IDE and we have GitHub all set up, I want to go through and do this first assignment, okay? So this first assignment that we're going to be doing is we're going to be creating an AI-assisted interactive calculator, okay? And so the idea is you're going to create a functional command line calculator and then that will be able to function and then we're going to push that up to get hub and save it there okay so what I want to do though so the easy way to do this is to just open up a chat prompt in your IDE and say create a simple calculator I don't want to do that for this assignment. What I want you to do is I want you to get in the process of thinking like a developer and going through the process of what is necessary or what is needed in order for this program to work. And then when you get stuck or you have troubles, then we can go to artificial intelligence and kind of help and fill in the gaps. Okay, so let me show you kind of what I have in mind. So let me pull over my cursor. Okay, so I have cursor here. And what I'm going to do real quick is I'm going to go into cursor here. and we are going to create a new folder and we're going to call this we're going to call this AI calculator okay so we have this file created So now what we're going to do is we're going to open a project here in Cursor and I'm going to go to Cursor and I have my AI calculator there at the top. So I'm going to go ahead and open this folder and I'm going to select the folder. Okay, so now what we have here is we have the AI calculator. There's no files included in here. We have new chat, but we're going to be going to the terminal, and you'll see that this opens up the actual folder that we're creating. And for this one, I'm just going to use the Gemini. So I'm using Gemini Pro. You can just type in copilot if you want. So for instance, if I do another terminal, I could just do I will load my co-pilot CLI okay the other one would be launching another one for Gemini okay so we have Gemini pulled up or not Gemini co-pilot actually I want to do Gemini so let's Let's just do it, let me know. Terminal, and I'm gonna do Gemini. Okay, doesn't matter which one. Okay, so Gemini's gonna load here in a second. So the, like I was saying earlier, the easy way to go about this is to just type it into the prompt here and it will create an entire calculator for you. um there we go so it loaded with all my cash credentials so then i could say um create a simple calculator how and it would make it for me but i don't want to do that right now okay so what i want to do is i want to um have us go through that process so first thing i'm going to do though is i want to create a virtual environment so let's just have gemini do that for us create a virtual environment for me okay okay so it's going to do this it's going through that process um i'm going to always allow on this one it'll start creating the virtual environment anytime you create a new project you want to have a virtual environment Okay, so we'll go ahead and let that create the virtual environment for me. So I could, let's see, I need to get a new terminal just to play around with, but I won't worry about it. Oh, I do have it. I have this terminal which is my get out copilot and I have this one here which is Gemini. So then it created my virtual environment here. I've created a virtual environment. You can activate it by running this in PowerShell. Let's say go ahead and activate it. Gemini is kind of fun because it always has, when it's waiting, it has these little quick Yep, we're going to allow that to activate. Okay. It's been activated. Great. So now we're going to, here in this folder, we're going to do a new text file. Okay. So this is where we're going to generate our code. So this is what I want you to think of. Now I want you to think like a developer. Okay, I need to create a calculator app. So any ideas or thoughts about the structure? I mean, the best idea would be to write this out on paper. Okay, So, for instance, you would say, you would look at, okay, what needs to be done first, what do I want it to look like, stuff like that. But let's just go ahead here. Oops, I don't want to do that. I just want to start typing. I want to say, okay, well, first thing I want to do is I want to import libraries needed for a calculator. So that's the first thing I'm going to type, that's the first thing I need. So when I press enter, then it will give me this option to import Tinker as TK. So I'm going to press tab, and that goes and imports that. Okay, great. So the next thing that I'm going to do is I want to, let's see, this is from Tinker import TK, Okay, why not? That has a lot of other things there. Let's do import math. I think that's probably pretty good. Now that we have, and you don't wanna just select everything that it says here, right? That's not always gonna be right. You gotta think it through, okay? I need to import the libraries. And if I'm like, ooh, I'm not quite sure, what if I go back here and I say import basic libraries needed for calculator app in Python. Tinker, that, let's do, I mean, if you keep tapping, I'll keep doing all these things. I don't know if you need all of those, but why not? Just play around with it. Let's do import math. And then it has all these different things, but let's just end with math. Okay? So you can kind of play around with all of these. Okay? I'm just going to get rid of some of these. And it doesn't matter if we get some wrong, get some right, because we're going to be doing that a little bit later so let's say we just have those three next thing we need to do is we need to um what's called create a class for the calculator app okay so if i go create um class for the calculator app then you can see it kind of starts pulling some of these things in here so i'm just going to go ahead and press tab and bring all of those in And we have root, title, geometry, configure, resizable, icon, bitmap, geometry, okay? And then, let's see, we want to, now that we have like this class, we need to kind of make sure that we actually have, like, a user interface for this calculator. So I like this, create a frame for the calculator. What if we do, like, create a frame for the input? Okay. So we're going to do, like, We can kind of just play around with what they give us here. Okay. All right. And then let's do create a frame, and then let's actually create an input field. Create an input field for the user to enter the expression. That looks good to me. Okay, so we want my pk entry, what else do we want? We have pack there, put a grid, find, keep itself, and put .grid, see if that does anything, you want to make like a grid for it uh yeah there we go like that okay um so that's our input field uh we need to create buttons so we need a frame for the buttons so you can see we're just kind of going through create frame for the buttons why not do that sounds good um those buttons we're going to have rows right we're going to have the first row second row so how about this create buttons for the first row of the calculator okay you can do that the second row Third row, fourth row, okay, so kind of playing around, let's see if there's a fifth row, let's see row, why not, okay. And you draw this out, like I'm just kind of going along with this, draw out your calculator and say how many rows of buttons do I want, okay. So, now we need to say, okay, what happens when I click on these buttons. So I need to define what happens when I click a button, okay? Click button, and then you can kind of look at that. Okay, let's see, scroll down a little bit. And then we can look at, okay, what if I click on the define the clear? button. Okay. So we can put that. Let it be defined equal. What happens when I put the equal button okay and so you want to start doing this for all your buttons multiply all you know all the way down okay so um you're gonna define all that and then when we get to the very end Let's just say I have those created, and then I say, okay, now I want to create a command line interface for the calculator out. Okay, then you take a look at it and go, okay, well, maybe that'll work. Let's go ahead and press play and see what happens. Oh, I've got to save it first. Call it AI Calculator, save. Okay, so now it's going to try to run it. Oh, and there's a bunch of errors, okay, which I expected, okay, because we just went through a strike. Okay, well, I've kind of did some of these things. This is where I want you now, after you've kind of struggled around with this a little bit. I want you to now go into the Gemini and say, hey, my calculator app didn't work. Can you go through and troubleshoot it for me? Okay, so this first step is having having you get familiar with what the code should look like kind of like conceptualizing it i don't expect it to work properly but this is using ai assisted um you know coding in the command line and then you can see here um where was my last thing of course uh read the file okay i see the calculator i'll read its context understand i analyzed the code found several issues the app just trying to use an icon file that doesn't exist, some redundant user interface code, buttons aren't actually being created. So it's like, I'll start by fixing the icon. So then it's gonna go through this. I'm gonna go ahead and click yes, allow once. Then I'm just gonna do this step by step so you can see what it's doing. Next, I'll add the missing button creation logic, okay? So it's gonna be going through this process now. Yes, we're gonna go ahead and allow that. And so you can see as it's changing things, it's not, a lot of what we did was good, okay? And it's just needing to fix a few different elements, okay? So here, let's go ahead and allow this, add buttons, okay? Now it's going to be going through, fixing some of the grid. So you can see this isn't, if you've never coded before, this isn't a simple, you know, 10-line program. It can be quite extensive, but that's why AI is so great, because it can help us with all this. Okay, rebuild the button loop. But if you have an idea of how things are supposed to run, then I think that gets you most of the way there. Okay, so now I did this calculator out. We can see if it works. 12 times 12 equals 144. That looks right. Divided by 12 equals 12 plus 12 equals 24 minus 12 equals 12. Clear. okay so that looks like it's working pretty good so far so this is what we're or what I'm looking for here in the first assignment because I want you to go through use AI as an assistant to try to conceptualize what the app should look like and then let's see and that's one of my instructions the app is working Well, thanks. Okay, so, ending the conversation, good. So we got that. So we're going to go ahead and go file, and we're going to go ahead and save this. Now, the next step is we want to push this all the way over to GitHub, okay? So we're like, oh, we got our calculator, AI calculator app. Right here, so here is you have your files, you have your search. if you click here, you can initialize a repository and publish it to GitHub. So once published, you'll have access to source controls. It doesn't have a Git repository, you can initialize. So let's go ahead and initialize a repository. And so now it's going to go through and it's going to say, okay, here is everything that we did. and if what I want to do here then is I can say okay well I want to you want a message a commit message so I'm just going to generate one with AI. I don't know how long that will take but we'll go ahead and do that and then we'll have all the changes that were made to this file and then we'll go ahead and commit that. We'll never, I don't know why this takes a moment to just say first federation. Then we can go ahead and commit it. We didn't like that I stopped the that for mine. Let's see. I need all those changes, open changes, discard, stage, all changes. I literally did this like a few minutes ago when I committed it and it worked fine. So let's go back here, come back here, this, select the source control, So, provided it does not have any source of transfer items, let's see, this may open. Anyway, you'll commit it here, and then it should just push to your GitHub, and it might ask for like a login, and if it asks for a login, you can go ahead and do that. But what happens when it eventually pushes, where's my GitHub, let me pull it up, GitHub, Okay, we're going to go here. Go ahead and log in. Okay, so if you go to your home, you can then go to like your repositories, your profile, and go to my repositories, and I uploaded one today, which is my website, and then it will look like this. okay everything that you uploaded will be pushed and you can see I just did that two hours ago so that's what's kind of annoying is now here I am trying to commit this and it's not working okay commit that might work now anyway you'll ask if you want to do it on a private or make it public let me do that okay this is going on there we go yeah there are no stage three would you like to stage all your and then commit them directly we're going to say would you like to stage yeah okay well I don't know if you saw my notice my CPU is running hot right now at 99% and so I am wondering if it's just being slow anyway there we go and that's fine so we are going to publish this branch. Publish to private repository is what I want to do. Okay, there we go. Now it's uploading my files. I think I just clicked it one too many times. Let's see if that works now. First iteration. Okay, so now I can go ahead. It looks like it worked. and then we're going to escalate on that and then I can open that in GitHub and then you'll see here's my calculator. Okay? So that's what I'm looking for. There might be some other little requirements in there that you need to do, but that's essentially the walkthrough of that assignment. Good luck.
