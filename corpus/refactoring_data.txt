o	Title: Assignment 5: Refactoring for Structured Data
o	Overview: This challenge focuses on code quality and data integrity. Your task is to refactor the CLI application from the previous module to handle data in a more structured way. Instead of storing simple strings or disconnected variables, you must represent each data item as a dictionary and manage the collection of these items in a list.
o	Technical Challenge Requirements: You must modify your existing Python script. When a user adds a new item, the program must create a single Python dictionary to represent that item. The keys of the dictionary must correspond to the fields defined in your project_plan.md. This complete dictionary object must be added to a master list that holds all data. The function responsible for listing items must be updated to iterate through the list of dictionaries. The application's external behavior from the user's perspective should remain identical to the previous version.
Deliverables: The updated Python script file for your CLI application.

 Okay, so last time we went through and inputted the general overview and then the chunk one of the program, which is the command light interface application prototype. And so where I left you last time was that I had loaded that stuff in and I was waiting for it to build. And then it was up to you to have to go through and troubleshoot it and get it to work. so I want to pull up my the the code that it created so you can see I have my virtual environment here I have some environment folders here this one is an example this one's a one I actually created I'm not going to click on those because it has my my API keys in there but that's where you put your API keys for your specific project and then you have your git ignore you have your actual chat bot or for me my actual program code you can see it developed how many lines of code about 223 lines of code for me it has like a readme which talks about what this app is doing and then it has requirement text things that needed to be uploaded for it to work so um when i first did it uh you can see i have it built it for me and it was having a few issues so i kind of just copy and pasted those issues um that it was having um and it would troubleshoot those for me one of which was like needing to add the api key um just some other little things um Pretty simple to solve. And so now here at the end, if I open this up and type in the command, then it will now in my command line say, well, welcome to the Info 6200 student Q&A chatbot. Hello, I'm your AI teaching assistant for Info 6200. I'm here to help you with Python coding questions and course content. Loading course materials, no corpus files found. This is just because I'm basically building a shell. I don't have all this corpus of information, PDF documents or MP4 files. And so that's why there was no information. You can ask me questions about the course, type exit to quit commands, and then the commands are saved. So we'll save the last Q&A pair, list, view all the saved Q&A pairs, exit the end of the session. So this is what needs to be completed in order to move on to the next section, right? So you can't move on to the next chunk until this one's done. So this is what your homework should have looked like by the end of last time, where you actually have a command line program that's actually functional, okay? So then I can type in something here. I don't know how do I how do I create a virtual environment okay so to create a virtual environment Python follow these steps okay so this is just pulling from minstrel um right now uh and the reason i do want to show you something real quick um i use minstrel uh here's the api keys but you get free access to their api if you're just doing it for experiment or um or like testing and stuff like that so i just went to like here um i uh i said like try the ai studio created a login and then um and then here it brought me to this dashboard i clicked uh api keys and then had me select what payment plan and then you just select the free one because you're just experimenting and then you come back here and then create new key and it will give you a key okay so um that's kind of what you're doing with that so now what we're going to do here in step two is, or chunk two, we're now on module five. And so the, what we're going to be doing here is we're going to be refactoring for structured data. So we have this command line interface that we built and is working really now. So you, I'm just going to type exit to get out of it. Thank you for using the chatbot. Good luck with your studies. Actually, pretty cool, right? But you can't use this right now because it's in my command line interface. And so we're eventually going to get to the point where I can launch this and you guys would be able to go on and use it. So let me go ahead and minimize this for now. We're back here at this document. Our chunk two, I am going to, let's just, let's do goal. Let me do bold. Goal. And then we're going to do tasks. And then we're going to do core files to create, even if we have any for this one. Okay. So that's kind of what we're going to be doing. and then I'm just going to do a little bit formatting because I'm a little bit OCD and I like things to be okay there we go all right so now here's chunk two chunk two is what we title it is essentially the the name of the homework or what we're going to be doing So we're going to be doing refractoring, factoring for structured data. Okay. Refactoring for structured data is what we're going to be calling this. And then we're going to be going through and typing out our goal. So we are going to, let's see, design and implement. Here, let me just type this out. We're going to be design and implement a data model for, and then a data model for this queue and a chat bot program. okay um we want to use uh let's see we are going to be doing the overview of this challenges to focus on code quality and data data integrity uh we want to refactor um so we're going to Factor this CLI program to handle data in a more structured way. a structured way. I want to, let's see, represent the data, or I would best each data item as a dictionary and manage the collection of these items in a list. I want to have the dictionary be saved in a new file that can be accessed in a new session if needed okay so essentially what we're doing last time the memory in chunk one was working just in the session right this one we're going to try to save it to a new file and then be able to recall that data from that file in any session that we open up okay so the tasks that we are going to do here let's go ahead and create another numbered list here so task number one we need to modify existing Python script to create a single Python dictionary to represent that item I want this to to be added to new file in the folder that can be accessed from any session. Okay, let's see there's anything else okay um this needs okay um session that's one thing that needs to do and he needs to update the folder after every session user experience should remain the same okay create core files to create let's do a new dictionary, stored, queue, and a conversations. Okay, so that has a lot of things here. We need the updated. Okay, so what I'm gonna do here, instead of doing the whole thing, I'm just gonna copy that chunk too. And I'm gonna go back here. and I am going to click back to my conversation with GitHub Copilot and I'm just going to paste chunk two here. Did I copy all of chunk two? Sure. Yep, that's all good. So I'm going to press enter. Chunk two. So this is what it's going to do. it's going to rewrite my code and it's reading the chatbot okay so um edit chatbot um when i import date time that looks good so that's going to give us a date and time of the um of the uh the chat and the conversation for our little database um it's going to do some refactoring for persistent storage. Okay, so now it's working through all of this. And then once it's done, Q and A conversations.json. Cool. So that will then become part of the corpus of information that it is able to get. And then you can see here, I have this corpus, and there's nothing in there. There's a file or folder that was created, I can show you here in just a second. And that is where you would add your corpus of information. You could just drag and drop PDFs, docs, and MP4s. so we're just waiting for this to refactor um so this this week is a little bit simpler um but uh because we're just we're enhancing what we've already done perfect and let's uh verify json files created so and that's what's so cool about the command line interface with like github copilot here and cursor is you just plug it in and let it run and that's what makes it so great. So yeah, so now it's writing and testing and seeing how things are working. While that is going, let me pull up this files. Hopefully this won't be too slow. Okay, so now I'm going to go into cursor. Now I'm going to go into my student Q&A chat box. Okay, so here's the corpus, right? If I click on there, I can add files to this corpus. This is kind of like creating a retrieval augmented generation agent. And then it's creating the conversations right there looks like it's working okay so um let me close this out let's see what this is doing okay perfect chunk two is complete here's what i've implemented summary of changes structured data model id unique identifier question answer ai's response time stamp saved at when it was saved. Awesome. I love this. Created a Q&A conversation JSON file. All saved Q&A pairs persist across the session. User experience remains identical. Same command, save, list, exit the same way. File structure changed from dictionary to list of dictionaries for better scalability. And then now it successfully does, saves the Q&A pairs to this. So now we can test with when ready. So let's go here and then we want to, am I in the BNV? Does it look like it? Where is it? Oh yeah, here we go. So I'm just going to copy this and then I'm going to paste the same thing here and I'm going to run it. Usually with smaller changes, you don't have too many errors. So this looks pretty good. So now let's say, tell me how to create a virtual environment, vnv, and then remember we have save is if we want to save everything. okay i'm gonna go ahead and press save save q a uh number two list and then it listed what we did and then now i could ask another question um how do i um um, add an API to my file, save. Okay, cool. So, um, now what I want to check is, I don't know, um, I want to check to make sure that this worked. So I'd go to cursor and then check my chatbot, and then Q&A conversations, I'm just going to open it up in a different, I'm going to use a VS Code to open it up and take a look, there we go, there's a Python list, tell me how to create a VNV, perfect, and then it has the answer, how do I add an API. So that is working correctly. Awesome. So I'm going to close that out. Let me close this out. This is now working really well. So I'm going to go ahead and just save that. Save all. Just save what I need to, I guess. And that is it for that next chunk two.
